## Project Task

Now that you've built a full-stack web application and have another project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer-competitive.

If you are opting out of career services, this is *still a required assignment*. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is *necessary* if you're applying for jobs, but it's also *critical* on your journey as a developer.
